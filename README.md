# Neural Nets from Scratch

I'm planning on diving into pytorch soon and get comfortable with implementing interesting deep learning papers. This little intro project is a chance for me to get more comfortable with how things work under the hood. I immplemented a feedforward network previous with [Andrew Ng's Stanford ML course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), but I haven't done a convolutional neural network as yet. I'm loosely following the path taken in [Michael Nielson's Neural Networks and Deep Learning online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

The libraries themselves are in the .py files, performance on some basic datasets are in the jupyter notebooks.
